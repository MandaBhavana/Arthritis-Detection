# 🦴 Knee Arthritis Detection

An end-to-end deep learning application for classifying knee osteoarthritis severity from knee X-ray images using **TensorFlow**, **DenseNet121**, and **Streamlit**.

## 📖 Overview

This project predicts the severity of knee osteoarthritis from X-ray images by classifying them into one of five grades (Grade 0–4). The application provides an interactive web interface where users can upload an X-ray image and receive the predicted arthritis grade along with the model's confidence.

> **Note:** This project is intended for educational and research purposes only. It is **not** a medical diagnostic tool.

## 📊 Model

- Architecture: DenseNet121
- Transfer Learning
- Five-class classification
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

Classes:

- Grade 0 – Normal
- Grade 1 – Doubtful
